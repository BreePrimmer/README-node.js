# README Generator Application

## Description

I wanted to build this application to get more experience using node.js and using inquirer. This application is very useful and it solves the problem of having to create a README from scratch everytime. With this application, you can create a professional README for your project faster. I learned how to write files that use my code with node.js, and I learned how to use inquirer to get user input.

## Usage

In the command line, type "node index.js" to run the readme generator application. The application will ask you questions in order to help you fill out your readme file. When it asks you to choose a license, use the arrow keys on your computer to select the license you want.

After you answer all the questions, the command line will let you know that your file was created. Look in the "Develop" folder for your new readme file. You will have to fix the indentation of the lines. After that, your readme is ready to go!
